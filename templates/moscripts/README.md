# Apps
## motmp
MOTMP is a simple CLI that allows you to create and edit temporary marimo notbook files with a managed virtual environment. It's a great way to quickly create notebooks for testing or prototyping. Under the hood uses nix package manager to execute `uv` to manage the fallback virtual environment. MOTMP uses a directory in `~/.cache/marimo/motmp` to store temporary notebooks by default. If `.` is passed as the destination argument the notebook will be created inplace and will search for `.venv` in the current working directory.


```bash
nix run github:andrewthomaslee/moscripts#motmp -- --help
```
